# In a logistic regression, the dependent variable is a dichotomous variable, i.e. a variable with only two values (1/0).
# So, for example, with the help of logistic regression, we can determine what has an influence on whether a certain disease is present(1) or not(0).
# The probability for the occurence is estimated.
# f(z) = 1 / (1+e^-z)
# z = the equation for linear regression (b_1.x_1 + b_2.x_2 + ... + b_k + x_k + a)
# Thus, the probability that the dependent variable is 1 is given by this equation for given values of the independent variables:
# P(y=1|x_1,...,x_n) = 1 / (1+e^-b_1.x_1 ... + b_k + x_k + a)
# For example:
# P(having the disease) = 1 / (1 + e^-(b_1.Age+b_2.Male+b_3.Smoker + a))
# The probability is a function of age, gender, and smoking status.
# Python can be used to calculate the coefficients b_1, b_2 to b_k and a:

import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Example data: age, gender (0 for female, 1 for male), smoking status (0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker)
X = np.array([[25, 1, 0],
              [30, 0, 1],
              [40, 1, 1],
              [35, 0, 0],
              [50, 1, 1]])

# Example target variable: whether the disease is present (1) or not (0)
y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1])

# Initialize logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y)

# Get the coefficients (b_1, b_2, ..., b_k) and intercept (a)
coefficients = model.coef_
intercept = model.intercept_

# Print the coefficients and intercept
print("Coefficients:", coefficients)
print("Intercept:", intercept)

# After obtaining the coefficients and intercept, you can plot the logistic function to
# visualize the relationship between the independent variables and the probability of the disease being present:

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Logistic function
def logistic_function(x, b, a):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(b * x + a)))

# Age range for plotting
age_range = np.linspace(20, 60, 100)

# Calculating probabilities for different values of age
probabilities = logistic_function(age_range, coefficients[0][0], intercept[0])

# Plotting the graph
plt.plot(age_range, probabilities, color='blue')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Probability of Disease Presence')
plt.title('Logistic Regression Curve')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
